# VanillaJS To Do App

Nothing Fancy just a small demo of the concepts of JS.

- tried to add reactivity to the UI using custom events
- custom events are fired for every interaction
- based on the event an actual API call is made (I know this is not truly reactive)
- Now we should filter the todo based on the id and update new todo.
- will implement these two approaches i.e. fetching data from server as well as managing it
  in-memory and making API calls later (kind of like optimistic UI)
